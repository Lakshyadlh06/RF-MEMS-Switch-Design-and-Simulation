# RF-MEMS-Switch-Design-and-Simulation
Design and Simulation of RF MEMS Switch

This project presents the modeling, design, and multiphysics simulation of a cantilever-based RF MEMS Switch using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study analyzes key performance parameters including pull-in voltage, tip displacement, stress distribution, and switching time, using five structural materials: Au, Ag, Al, Si, and SiC.

Electrostatic and structural mechanics physics are coupled to evaluate beam deflection under applied voltage, while time-dependent analysis is performed to determine switching speed. Results are validated using analytical equations and MATLAB-based post-processing. 

Key Features:-
1. 3D Cantilever RF MEMS switch design
2. Electrostatic actuation and pull-in voltage extraction
3. Time-dependent switching simulation
4. Material comparison: Au, Ag, Al, Si, SiC
5. Stress, displacement, and substrate position analysis
6. Analytical vs simulated switching time comparison

Tools Used:-
1. COMSOL Multiphysics
2. MATLAB (post-processing)
3. MEMS fabrication lab tools
